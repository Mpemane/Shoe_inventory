 ### Introduction
 The objective of this project was to write a python code that will keep track of shoe inventory. this achived via a series od methods and creating a Shoe class.
 ### Technologies
 The Technologies employed in this project are at follows:
 ### Libraries used:
import csv
<br />from tabulate import tabulate 
 ### Layout of the Jupyter NoteBook
<br /> Creat the Shoe class
<br />creat get_cost this method will return the cost of the shoe
<br />get_quanty this function will return the quantity of the shoes

<br />value_per_item - this function will calculate the total value for each item
<br />value = cost * quantity). Print this information on the console for all the shoes.
<br />highest_qty - Write code to determine the product with the highest quantity and print this shoe as being for sale.
